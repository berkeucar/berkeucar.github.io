## About Me
Hi! I am Berke and originally from [Balikesir, Turkey](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Balıkesir/@39.6478014,27.8197125,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x14b7003b8bbb36d7:0xea6e0949f8f4ea6a!8m2!3d39.6532976!4d27.8903423!16zL20vMDdjM18y?entry=ttu). At the present, I am studying in Vancouver, Canada. I love listening different genres of [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/11135641971?si=613add3fb1a64277), playing basketball and video games in my spare time. I try to play drums and guitar as much as possible. I also enjoy reading about politics, psychology, physics, and obviously biological computer science.

## Research Interests
I am a M.Sc. student at [UBC, Vancouver](https://www.bioinformatics.ubc.ca) working under the supervision of [Dr. İnanç Birol](https://www.bcgsc.ca/people/inanc-birol). I have a computer engineering background and have my Bachelor degree from [Bilkent University, Ankara](https://w3.cs.bilkent.edu.tr). During my undergraduate years, I worked on several projects about generative models, robotics, deep learning, and most importantly computational biology. Currently, I am focused on bioinformatics applications of machine learning to provide healthcare solutions with precision and efficiency. 
You can check my CV or LinkedIn profile for more details about my projects.

## News
